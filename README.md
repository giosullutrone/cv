# Short Bio

I'm a PhD student at the [University of Modena and Reggio Emilia](https://www.unimore.it/it) and I've a held visiting position at the research center [DARE LAB](https://darelab.athenarc.gr/).   My research focuses on **real-world LLMs' applications**, **AI Safety** and **Over-Safety**.

## ðŸ§ª Featured Works (TL;DR)

- **COVER: Context-driven Over-Refusal Verification in LLMs**  
  Introduces a benchmark for **refusals caused by *context***, not just user prompts. Across translation and summarization tasks, refusal rates spike disproportionately (up to **100% refusal**) â€” while question-answering remains stable. Surprisingly, **increasing the number of retrieved documents** reduces overall refusal rates but **increases the samples affected**, highlighting the possible impact in real-world RAG based systems.

- **Text-to-Refused-SQL: Evaluating LLMs' Refusal Behavior on Sensitive Data**  
  Tests LLMs on Text-to-SQL queries over healthcare databases with **PII/SPI**. Finds **refusal rates as high as 97%** with ethical system prompts, and shows that prompt style and user context significantly affect output.

- **Sensitive Topics Retrieval in Digital Libraries**  
  Uses a á¸¥adÄ«á¹¯ dataset to test retrieval on sensitive religious content. Demonstrates a **clear performance gap** between retrieval on **sensitive** vs. **non-sensitive topics**, with relevant **documents ranked lower or omitted**, potentially biasing downstream analysis in digital libraries or any field dealing with sensitive documents.

- **Text-to-SQL with LLMs: Exploring the Promise and Pitfalls**  
  Evaluates LLMs' performance on Text-to-SQL across accuracy, scalability, and hallucination. Identifies how **benchmarks fail to reflect real-world complexity** and highlights risks of untrustworthy queries, especially under ambiguous or large-scale input.

## ðŸ’¼ More About Myself

I co-founded **Vivi S.R.L.**, a startup aiming to democratize wine culture by making wine-by-the-glass sustainable and accessible, addressing economic and environmental issues in wine consumption. Our startup has won multiple awards, among many a bootcamp sponsored by *Amazon*.

I also co-hold an **international patent** for a liquid dispensing device that extracts wine or other liquids from sealed bottles without removing the cork â€” making it suitable for both home and professional use.
